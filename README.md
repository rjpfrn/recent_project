# recent_project
mini project

IN THIS PROJECT, I APPLIED ALL THE KNOWLEDGE I LEARNED FROM DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYSIS.
I USED THE NECESSARY LIBRARIES TO CLEAN, TRANSFORM, AND ANALYZE THE DATASET.
THE DATASET I USED IN THIS PROJECT IS FROM KAGGLE.

This project is about analyzing raw data to make useful output and information to use in making a decision and hypothesis.
> Generating new information that can help the analysis be easier and more efficient by thorough observation and comparison.
> Cleaning and fixing the format of column titles to make it easier to read and to invoke.
> Supplying all missing/null values by using zero or the median and mode values or by looking at a pattern can help to decide what value is accurate.
> Making additional information to make it easier to analyze by comparing a column to one another.
> Using SQL Aggregate functions in queries.
> Utilizing SQL 'VIEWS' to make a cleaner query and to lessen the length of queries.
> Using different Python libraries to make analysis faster.
> Making a visualization of data from a dataset with the use of visualization libraries of Python.
